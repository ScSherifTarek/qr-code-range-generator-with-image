![QR Code Generator With Prefix](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/075102b9-2d72-479b-a2ff-d47d5805a717)
In the image above, we generated QR Codes from numbers 1 to 100, all QR code values would have a prefix of `#CODE_NUMBER_`, so this would generate for us the following QR codes from left to right.
1. #CODE_NUMBER_1
2. #CODE_NUMBER_2
3. #CODE_NUMBER_3
4. #CODE_NUMBER_4
5. ...
6. #CODE_NUMBER_100
